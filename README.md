# MAST5112.P2The Chef Menu App is a React TypeScript project that allows a chef to create, view, and manage a restaurant menu by entering dish details such as the name, description, course type (starter, main, or dessert), and price. It uses core React features like components, state management (useState), and event handling to collect and display data dynamically. The homepage shows all menu items and the total number of dishes added, giving users a clear overview of the menu. This project demonstrates how to build a fully functional and visually appealing user interface using TypeScript, conditional logic, and layout styling, aligning with the learning goals of handling user input, managing data, and improving user experience through structured design.
